Welcome to the NSH Lab (pronounced like "niche") GitHub organization. We are a
(bio)statistical science research group focused primarily on developing novel
theory, methods, algorithms, and open-source software for causal inference and
statistical machine learning. We apply our work to data-driven, real-world
questions in the biomedical and public health sciences.

Here, you'll find a collection of our open-source software packages implementing
the methods that we have developed as well as reproducible research workflows
for each of our projects. More information about our research program may be
found at <https://nimahejazi.org/research>.
